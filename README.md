Key Concepts Learned:

This week, I focused on chapters one and two and would like to share a summary of the key concepts I learned:

A project is any collection of activities that has a clear start and end date and is designed to achieve specific objectives.

Here are the key characteristics of a project:  
- It is non-routine.  
- It is planned.  
- It aims for a particular target.  
- It involves work done for a customer.  
- It includes various specialties.  
- It consists of multiple phases.  
- It is limited by time and resources.  
- It can be large and/or complex.  

The Project Charter:  
The project charter is created by the organization's top management to initiate a software project. It essentially outlines the purpose of starting the project.

Project Scope:  
A comprehensive project scope is developed to define the project’s boundaries. This scope includes the required functionalities for the software being developed, as well as the quality level expected for the final product.

Application in Real Projects:

This semester, I am enrolled in the Programming and Problem Solving course, one of the more challenging offerings at Concordia University. The course demands a focused and strategic approach to resource allocation in order to succeed. The concepts I have learned about resource management, particularly the effective utilization of time and the distribution of effort across tasks, have significantly enhanced my ability to manage the workload for this course more efficiently.





________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Peer Interactions:

This week, our group for the course project convened for a meeting between members. During our discussion of potential project topics, we revisited key concepts and terminologies covered in the course slides. This review proved to be highly beneficial, as it provided clarity and helped guide our decision-making process.




________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Challenges Faced:

Since much of the course content involves extensive reading, the greatest challenge I have encountered is retaining the material. While I initially grasped all the concepts at the beginning of the week, I found it difficult to fully recall or review them later when needed.





________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Personal development activities:

I recently listened to a podcast by Andrew Huberman, where he discussed effective strategies for learning, particularly how to counteract forgetting. He emphasized that the best approach is to actively engage with the material by generating questions and attempting to answer them. Inspired by this, I have started formulating questions based on the course content. This way, when I review the material, I can focus on answering the questions rather than re-reading the entire set of slides, making the review process more efficient and targeted.


________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Goals for the Next Week:

We have a quiz scheduled for next week, so I plan to study Chapter 3 in detail and review Chapters 1 and 2 to ensure I am well-prepared for the assessment.

Key Concepts Learned:

Effort & Cost Estimation (Chapter 3)

Effort Estimation Techniques:

- Experience-based techniques rely on the knowledge and insights of experts and previous projects.
- Algorithmic cost modeling uses formulas to determine effort based on various project or product characteristics, such as size and team experience.
- Estimation by Analogy involves comparing a project to similar past projects to gauge effort based on their components.
- COCOMO (Constructive Cost Model) is a popular algorithmic cost estimation model that has evolved from COCOMO-81 to COCOMO 2. It includes several sub-models:
- Application Composition Model: This is used for projects that rely on existing components.
- Early Design Model: Ideal for the initial design phase when details are not fully established.
- Post-Architecture Model: This is utilized once the architecture has been finalized.

Function Point Analysis (FPA):

- This technique provides a way to measure software functionality from the user’s point of view by quantifying the capabilities a software system offers.

Function points are determined based on different types of data and transaction functions.

Chapter 4: Risk Management

Risk Identification and Assessment:
- Risks can influence the project's timeline, resource allocation, and overall product quality.
- They are categorized according to their probability of occurrence and potential impact. Some key categories include:
- Estimation risks: Errors in predicting project duration.
- Technical risks: Challenges that stem from technical difficulties or outdated technology.
-Organizational risks: Issues related to resource availability, legal matters, and similar factors.

Risk Response Strategies:

- Acceptance: This involves acknowledging the risk without taking further action, aside from identifying potential triggers and creating backup plans.

- Avoidance: This strategy involves modifying the project to completely remove the risk.

- Transference: This means shifting the responsibility for the risk to another party, such as through insurance or fixed-price contracts.

- Mitigation: This approach focuses on implementing proactive steps to lessen the chances or effects of a risk, such as incorporating additional testing or selecting reliable vendors.

New Terms:
- Risk Exposure: This is determined by multiplying the probability of a risk occurring by its potential impact.

- Risk Buffer: This refers to the extra time or resources added to help manage risks.

Application in Real Projects:



A few months ago, I was in a project to develop an employee scheduling app for restaurants. Early on, I realized that our project relied heavily on a new cloud technology that none of the team members had extensive experience with. Additionally, the restaurant industry was going through rapid changes in regulations due to the pandemic, which added uncertainty about some of the app’s features.
To make sure we didn’t hit major roadblocks later in the project, I organized a risk identification session with the team during the planning phase. We began by listing all the possible risks, including technical, organizational, and financial challenges. Here are some of the risks we identified:

Technical Risk: The new cloud technology might have a steep learning curve for our team, potentially causing delays or technical issues.

Organizational Risk: There was a chance that restaurants might not adopt the app if the pandemic regulations changed again.

Financial Risk: Unexpected costs could arise if we needed to bring in an external expert to help with the cloud technology.
Once we identified these risks, I prioritized them based on their potential impact and likelihood. I realized that the technical risk was a high-priority item because our entire project depended on the successful implementation of the new cloud platform. We rated this risk as high-impact and high-likelihood.




_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________


Peer Interactions:


This week, during a group project meeting for my problem solving course, my classmate, Parsa, pointed out that our original design for the app lacked security features for user data. Another peer, Farid, suggested implementing two-factor authentication, which hadn’t crossed my mind. Their input made me realize the importance of considering security early in development. The discussion sharpened my awareness of peer collaboration’s role in producing well-rounded solutions.


___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Challenges Faced: 


Understanding Estimation Techniques: I found some of the estimation techniques in Chapter 3, especially the Algorithmic Cost Modeling methods like COCOMO, a bit complex. The formulas and multipliers can be overwhelming, and I need to spend more time breaking down each component to grasp how they apply in different project scenarios.

Key Concepts Learned:
1. Configuration Management (Chapter 5)
•	Definition: Configuration Management (CM) is a process for controlling and documenting changes to a system, ensuring consistency and integrity.
•	Purpose: It organizes and manages multiple versions of a software product, addressing issues like scope creep and rework by establishing order and traceability.
•	Core Functions:
o	Configuration Identification: Defines and tracks all components and versions.
o	Configuration Control: Manages changes to items to prevent chaotic updates.
o	Status Accounting: Records changes and the current state of all items.
o	Auditing: Ensures the system aligns with the requirements and verifies product quality.
•	Benefits: CM reduces confusion, maintains product integrity, supports quality control, and mitigates legal risks by keeping thorough records of changes.
2. Project Planning (Chapter 6)
•	Definition: Project planning in software management involves creating a baseline to execute, monitor, and control the project.
•	Components:
o	Work Breakdown Structure (WBS): A hierarchical breakdown of project tasks, enabling effective scheduling and resource allocation.
o	Scheduling Methods: Two main approaches:
	Top-Down: Assigns time to large tasks first, then breaks them into smaller tasks.
	Bottom-Up: Estimates time for smaller tasks, then combines them to calculate the overall project timeline.
	
•	Milestones and Deliverables:
o	Milestones are checkpoints to assess progress.
o	Deliverables are tangible results or documents provided to stakeholders at each project phase.
•	Critical Path Method (CPM): Identifies the longest path of dependent tasks, setting the minimum project duration and highlighting where delays could occur.
3. Project Monitoring and Control (Chapter 7)
•	Purpose: Monitoring and control help project managers track progress, ensure quality, and take corrective action if deviations occur.
•	Monitoring vs. Control:
o	Monitoring collects data on project performance.
o	Control involves taking corrective actions when needed to align with project goals.
•	Key Tools:
o	Earned Value Management (EVM): Measures both schedule and budget performance by comparing planned vs. actual values, helping to identify variances.
o	Variance Analysis: Assesses differences between baseline and actual performance, prompting actions like resource reallocation or project rescheduling.
•	Scope and Risk Control: Ensures that changes in scope or new risks are managed to keep the project on track, often involving re-evaluation and updates to the project plan.


Application in Real Projects:
These concepts are totally common in industry, for example a software development team working on a new e-commerce platform. They use Configuration Management to track code changes, ensuring every team member accesses the latest version and preventing issues like overwritten features or misplaced updates. During Project Planning, they create a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), breaking down the project into tasks like front-end design, backend integration, and payment gateway setup. The team monitors progress through Earned Value Management (EVM), comparing actual costs and timelines to the planned values. When they detect a delay in backend integration, they quickly reallocate resources, keeping the project on track and within budget.

Peer Interactions/collaboration:
During a recent software project, I experienced Configuration Management (CM), and it quickly proved invaluable. Early on, I was collaborating with a few other developers, each working on different parts of the codebase. One day, I realized that an important feature I’d developed had somehow vanished after a merge, and a previous bug fix had reappeared. This was a classic CM issue, and it was clear we needed better version control to prevent these overlaps. By implementing CM tools and processes, like defining baseline versions and establishing check-in/check-out procedures, we avoided future mix-ups, kept track of changes easily, and ensured every team member was working with the latest code. This experience taught me firsthand how essential CM is for keeping software projects organized and efficient.

Challenges Faced: 
I've been grappling with Goldratt's critical chain method and how it addresses project management challenges. The concept seemed straightforward at first, but I quickly found myself tangled in the intricacies of task dependencies and resource allocation. I noticed that task slippage often occurred because one delayed task would cascade into others, throwing off the entire project timeline. This made it difficult for me to grasp how to effectively buffer tasks and manage constraints. As a result, I'm eager to find clarity on how to prevent these delays and streamline my project management skills.

Personal development activities:
I've realized that to achieve my goals, I need to organize my time and life more effectively. This involves creating a structured schedule that balances work, personal projects, and self-care. I'm exploring various tools and techniques to help me prioritize tasks and set realistic deadlines. By doing this, I aim to enhance my productivity while also making room for relaxation and leisure activities. Ultimately, my goal is to create a more harmonious life where I can thrive in all areas.

Goals for the Next Week:
As we move into the next phase of our project, I will be collaborating with my groupmates to complete another critical deliverable. This task is essential for ensuring that we stay on schedule and meet our project milestones. I’m looking forward to working together, as each of us brings unique skills and perspectives to the table. By effectively communicating and coordinating our efforts, I believe we can produce a high-quality outcome that reflects our collective hard work. I'm excited about the opportunity to learn from my teammates and contribute to the project's success.

Key Concepts Learned:
Chapter 8: Project Closure
1.	Project Closure Activities: Involves finalizing project deliverables, ensuring all tasks are complete, and confirming that project goals have been met.
2.	Source Code and Version Management: Ensuring the latest versions of all files are properly stored and documented.
3.	Data Archiving: Filtering and archiving project metrics to retain essential data for future reference.
4.	Lessons Learned: Reviewing archived data to understand successes and challenges, which is valuable for improving future projects.
Chapter 9: Software Lifecycle Management 
1.	Software Lifecycle Models: Covers models for software development, including the Waterfall model (linear approach) and Iterative Models like SCRUM and Extreme Programming that allow rework and flexibility.
2.	Concurrent Engineering: Discusses parallel work on different software lifecycle stages to improve efficiency.
3.	Work Products and Quality Gates: Each lifecycle stage has specific work products (outputs), and quality gates ensure each phase meets required standards before moving forward.
4.	Comparison of Models: Highlights that the Waterfall model suits projects needing a stable backbone (e.g., ERP systems), while iterative models suit projects requiring adaptability to technological changes.




Application in Real Projects:
In my last project, we used SCRUM to develop a new mobile app, which allowed us to iterate quickly. At the end of each sprint, we had a working feature set, which helped us adapt to changing client requirements without massive rework. I was responsible for version management of the code, ensuring every update was documented and securely archived. When we wrapped up, we had a formal project closure session where we reviewed our metrics—like sprint velocity and defect rates—and archived these for future projects.
In the closure meeting, we also discussed lessons learned. One big takeaway was the value of quality gates at each lifecycle stage, which caught potential issues early and saved us from last-minute fixes. By the end, I felt that managing each phase and reflecting on our performance gave us a better foundation for the next project.


Peer Interactions:
This week, our team wrapped up a mobile app project using the Waterfall model. Since we were working with a large corporate client, the project needed a solid backbone, so a linear approach was the best fit. I coordinated with Martin and Erfan to complete the quality gates for each phase, ensuring our requirements, design, and testing phases met standards before moving forward.
During one of our discussions, Martin suggested that even though we were following Waterfall, we could incorporate lessons learned from our previous projects and keep an archive of the issues encountered and resolved. This insight helped us avoid some design pitfalls early on. Erfan, on the other hand, had great suggestions for data archiving in a way that made filtering through version histories easier. Together, we found that being proactive about metrics tracking made our project progress more transparent and manageable, something we all agreed to carry forward in our next projects


Challenges Faced:
This week, I encountered a few challenges with understanding the nuances of software lifecycle models. Specifically, I struggled to fully grasp when to apply the Waterfall model versus iterative models like SCRUM. While I understand the theory, real-life scenarios with rapidly changing requirements made me question which model would be best suited for such projects.
I also found quality gates and data archiving a bit tricky. I could see their value in ensuring standards, but I wasn’t entirely clear on how to implement them consistently across different phases without slowing down progress. I plan to put extra effort into studying examples of quality gates and explore more on SCRUM. Additionally, I'll review any archived project data I can access to see how past teams used these methods effectively.

Personal development activities:

Recently, I added a regular workout routine to my schedule, which has been a game-changer for my productivity at work. I started with short morning workouts to energize myself before the workday, and it made a noticeable difference. I felt more focused and less fatigued, especially during long stretches of project work or meetings.
One of the biggest challenges was building the habit, but I quickly realized that staying active gave me a mental boost, helping me tackle complex tasks with a clear mind. This extra energy and clarity have made me feel more capable and less stressed when managing multiple projects. Now, I’m not only sticking to my fitness goals but also seeing my professional performance improve in real-time.


Goals for the Next Week:
With the final exam and our project deadline approaching, I realized I needed a solid plan to stay on top of everything. First, I decided to map out a review schedule for the course content, breaking down each chapter and topic by day. My goal is to cover a set amount of material daily, with extra time for difficult concepts. 
For the project, I created a checklist for final deliverables, prioritizing tasks and setting mini-deadlines to avoid last-minute scrambling.
