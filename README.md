Key Concepts Learned:

This week, I focused on chapters one and two and would like to share a summary of the key concepts I learned:

A project is any collection of activities that has a clear start and end date and is designed to achieve specific objectives.

Here are the key characteristics of a project:  
- It is non-routine.  
- It is planned.  
- It aims for a particular target.  
- It involves work done for a customer.  
- It includes various specialties.  
- It consists of multiple phases.  
- It is limited by time and resources.  
- It can be large and/or complex.  

The Project Charter:  
The project charter is created by the organization's top management to initiate a software project. It essentially outlines the purpose of starting the project.

Project Scope:  
A comprehensive project scope is developed to define the project’s boundaries. This scope includes the required functionalities for the software being developed, as well as the quality level expected for the final product.

Application in Real Projects:

This semester, I am enrolled in the Programming and Problem Solving course, one of the more challenging offerings at Concordia University. The course demands a focused and strategic approach to resource allocation in order to succeed. The concepts I have learned about resource management, particularly the effective utilization of time and the distribution of effort across tasks, have significantly enhanced my ability to manage the workload for this course more efficiently.

Peer Interactions:

This week, our group for the course project convened for a meeting between members. During our discussion of potential project topics, we revisited key concepts and terminologies covered in the course slides. This review proved to be highly beneficial, as it provided clarity and helped guide our decision-making process.

Challenges Faced:

Since much of the course content involves extensive reading, the greatest challenge I have encountered is retaining the material. While I initially grasped all the concepts at the beginning of the week, I found it difficult to fully recall or review them later when needed.

Personal development activities:

I recently listened to a podcast by Andrew Huberman, where he discussed effective strategies for learning, particularly how to counteract forgetting. He emphasized that the best approach is to actively engage with the material by generating questions and attempting to answer them. Inspired by this, I have started formulating questions based on the course content. This way, when I review the material, I can focus on answering the questions rather than re-reading the entire set of slides, making the review process more efficient and targeted.



Goals for the Next Week:

We have a quiz scheduled for next week, so I plan to study Chapter 3 in detail and review Chapters 1 and 2 to ensure I am well-prepared for the assessment.
