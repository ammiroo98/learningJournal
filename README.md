Key Concepts Learned:

This week, I focused on chapters one and two and would like to share a summary of the key concepts I learned:

A project is any collection of activities that has a clear start and end date and is designed to achieve specific objectives.

Here are the key characteristics of a project:  
- It is non-routine.  
- It is planned.  
- It aims for a particular target.  
- It involves work done for a customer.  
- It includes various specialties.  
- It consists of multiple phases.  
- It is limited by time and resources.  
- It can be large and/or complex.  

The Project Charter:  
The project charter is created by the organization's top management to initiate a software project. It essentially outlines the purpose of starting the project.

Project Scope:  
A comprehensive project scope is developed to define the project’s boundaries. This scope includes the required functionalities for the software being developed, as well as the quality level expected for the final product.

Application in Real Projects:

This semester, I am enrolled in the Programming and Problem Solving course, one of the more challenging offerings at Concordia University. The course demands a focused and strategic approach to resource allocation in order to succeed. The concepts I have learned about resource management, particularly the effective utilization of time and the distribution of effort across tasks, have significantly enhanced my ability to manage the workload for this course more efficiently.





________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Peer Interactions:

This week, our group for the course project convened for a meeting between members. During our discussion of potential project topics, we revisited key concepts and terminologies covered in the course slides. This review proved to be highly beneficial, as it provided clarity and helped guide our decision-making process.




________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Challenges Faced:

Since much of the course content involves extensive reading, the greatest challenge I have encountered is retaining the material. While I initially grasped all the concepts at the beginning of the week, I found it difficult to fully recall or review them later when needed.





________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Personal development activities:

I recently listened to a podcast by Andrew Huberman, where he discussed effective strategies for learning, particularly how to counteract forgetting. He emphasized that the best approach is to actively engage with the material by generating questions and attempting to answer them. Inspired by this, I have started formulating questions based on the course content. This way, when I review the material, I can focus on answering the questions rather than re-reading the entire set of slides, making the review process more efficient and targeted.


________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Goals for the Next Week:

We have a quiz scheduled for next week, so I plan to study Chapter 3 in detail and review Chapters 1 and 2 to ensure I am well-prepared for the assessment.

Key Concepts Learned:

Effort & Cost Estimation (Chapter 3)

Effort Estimation Techniques:

- Experience-based techniques rely on the knowledge and insights of experts and previous projects.
- Algorithmic cost modeling uses formulas to determine effort based on various project or product characteristics, such as size and team experience.
- Estimation by Analogy involves comparing a project to similar past projects to gauge effort based on their components.
- COCOMO (Constructive Cost Model) is a popular algorithmic cost estimation model that has evolved from COCOMO-81 to COCOMO 2. It includes several sub-models:
- Application Composition Model: This is used for projects that rely on existing components.
- Early Design Model: Ideal for the initial design phase when details are not fully established.
- Post-Architecture Model: This is utilized once the architecture has been finalized.

Function Point Analysis (FPA):

- This technique provides a way to measure software functionality from the user’s point of view by quantifying the capabilities a software system offers.

Function points are determined based on different types of data and transaction functions.

Chapter 4: Risk Management

Risk Identification and Assessment:
- Risks can influence the project's timeline, resource allocation, and overall product quality.
- They are categorized according to their probability of occurrence and potential impact. Some key categories include:
- Estimation risks: Errors in predicting project duration.
- Technical risks: Challenges that stem from technical difficulties or outdated technology.
-Organizational risks: Issues related to resource availability, legal matters, and similar factors.

Risk Response Strategies:

- Acceptance: This involves acknowledging the risk without taking further action, aside from identifying potential triggers and creating backup plans.

- Avoidance: This strategy involves modifying the project to completely remove the risk.

- Transference: This means shifting the responsibility for the risk to another party, such as through insurance or fixed-price contracts.

- Mitigation: This approach focuses on implementing proactive steps to lessen the chances or effects of a risk, such as incorporating additional testing or selecting reliable vendors.

New Terms:
- Risk Exposure: This is determined by multiplying the probability of a risk occurring by its potential impact.

- Risk Buffer: This refers to the extra time or resources added to help manage risks.

- Risk Buffer: This refers to the extra time or resources added to help manage risks.	A few months ago, I was in a project to develop an employee scheduling app for restaurants. Early on, I realized that our project relied heavily on a new cloud technology that none of the team members had extensive experience with. Additionally, the restaurant industry was going through rapid changes in regulations due to the pandemic, which added uncertainty about some of the app’s features.
To make sure we didn’t hit major roadblocks later in the project, I organized a risk identification session with the team during the planning phase. We began by listing all the possible risks, including technical, organizational, and financial challenges. Here are some of the risks we identified:

Technical Risk: The new cloud technology might have a steep learning curve for our team, potentially causing delays or technical issues.

Organizational Risk: There was a chance that restaurants might not adopt the app if the pandemic regulations changed again.

Financial Risk: Unexpected costs could arise if we needed to bring in an external expert to help with the cloud technology.
Once we identified these risks, I prioritized them based on their potential impact and likelihood. I realized that the technical risk was a high-priority item because our entire project depended on the successful implementation of the new cloud platform. We rated this risk as high-impact and high-likelihood.
	This week, during a group project meeting for my problem solving course, my classmate, Parsa, pointed out that our original design for the app lacked security features for user data. Another peer, Farid, suggested implementing two-factor authentication, which hadn’t crossed my mind. Their input made me realize the importance of considering security early in development. The discussion sharpened my awareness of peer collaboration’s role in producing well-rounded solutions.	Understanding Estimation Techniques: I found some of the estimation techniques in Chapter 3, especially the Algorithmic Cost Modeling methods like COCOMO, a bit complex. The formulas and multipliers can be overwhelming, and I need to spend more time breaking down each component to grasp how they apply in different project scenarios.
	As part of my commitment to professional development, I have enrolled in full-time French courses. This initiative is driven by my desire to enhance my language skills and better engage in the diverse, bilingual environment of Canada. By immersing myself in French, I aim to improve my communication abilities, collaborate more effectively with colleagues and clients, and expand my career opportunities. I believe that mastering French will not only enrich my professional interactions but also deepen my understanding of cultural nuances, ultimately making me a more effective and adaptable professional in today’s global landscape.	To prepare for the upcoming quiz, I am concentrating on studying Chapter 5 and also going over important content from earlier chapters to ensure I fully understand the material. This strategy will help me reinforce key concepts and link them to the broader themes of the course. 

In addition, I plan to arrange a meeting with my classmates to work together on our upcoming course project. Participating in group discussions will allow us to share ideas and improve our problem-solving skills, which will ultimately benefit the success of our project. By balancing my individual studying with teamwork, I hope to gain a deeper understanding of the subject while promoting collaboration and accountability within our group.
